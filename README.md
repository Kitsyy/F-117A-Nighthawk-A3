# F-117A-Nighthawk-A3

Hello! This is a project for the game Arma 3, and it consists of a 1 to 1, fully functional F-117A Nighthawk. Fully textured to best depict what it would feel like to fly the real
thing! This is very WIP at the moment. I am part of a team called PROJECT - Orion, which has the same ideaology that I have. To distribute high fidelity, high poly models to the 
ARMA franchise. Also, Project Hatchet team has been side to side with this aircraft, so we can push out only the best for the community!
